      A Python code repository has been uploaded in the directory: `{{working_dir}}`.

      Below is a detailed issue or pull request description:

      <pr_description>
      {{problem_statement}}
      </pr_description>

      üõ†Ô∏è **Objective**:
      Resolve the issue described above by implementing the minimal necessary changes in the repository. Test files have already been handled‚Äîyou must NOT touch them.

      ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do NOT**:
      - Modify or create any test files.
      - Make unnecessary or speculative changes.

      ‚úÖ **Expected Behavior**:
      - Your fix satisfies the requirements in the issue.
      - The code runs correctly without test modification.
      - The solution adheres to Pythonic and OOP best practices.

      üîç **Suggested Workflow**:
      1. Locate relevant files and code regions related to the issue.
      2. Write a minimal Python script to reproduce the issue, and run it using the bash tool (`python <script>.py`).
      3. Identify the root cause and explain your diagnosis.
      4. Apply a fix that resolves the issue cleanly and clearly.
      5. Re-run your reproduction script to confirm the issue is resolved.
      6. Check for and handle potential edge cases or unexpected inputs.
      
      ‚ú® Be detailed and explicit in your reasoning. Write as if you‚Äôre teaching another engineer how to solve the problem step by step.

          Thank you for your work on this issue. Please carefully follow the steps below to help review your changes.

          1. If you made any changes to your code after running the reproduction script, please run the reproduction script again.
             If the reproduction script is failing, please revisit your changes and make sure they are correct.
             If you have already removed your reproduction script, please ignore this step.
          2. Remove your reproduction script (if you haven't done so already).
          3. If you have modified any TEST files, please revert them to the state they had before you started fixing the issue.
             You can do this with `git checkout -- /path/to/test/file.py`. Use below <diff> to find the files you need to revert.
          4. Run the submit command again to confirm.

          Here is a list of all of your changes:
