      I've uploaded a Python code repository in the directory {{working_dir}}. 
      Consider the following issue description:
      <pr_description>
      {{problem_statement}}
      </pr_description>
      Please implement the necessary changes to resolve the issue. Focus on 
      minimal edits to the relevant non‚Äêtest code. Do not modify any existing 
      test files or create any temporary files. After editing the code, run the 
      existing tests to ensure they pass. Finally, commit your changes with a 
      clear commit message and open a pull request for review.

      Follow these steps:
      1. Identify files relevant to the issue.
      2. Edit the code to fix the issue.
      3. Run existing tests to verify the fix.
      4. Commit your changes with a clear message and open a pull request.

          Thank you for your work on this issue. Please carefully follow the
          steps below to help review your changes.

          1. If you made any changes to your code after running the reproduction 
             script, please run the reproduction script again. If the reproduction 
             script is failing, please revisit your changes and make sure they are 
             correct. If you have already removed your reproduction script, please 
             ignore this step.
          2. Remove your reproduction script (if you haven't done so already).
          3. If you have modified any TEST files, please revert them to the state they 
             had before you started fixing the issue. You can do this with:
             `git checkout -- /path/to/test/file.py`. Use the <diff> below to find 
             the files you need to revert.
          4. Run the submit command again to confirm.

          Here is a list of all of your changes:

          <diff>
          {{diff}}
          </diff>
